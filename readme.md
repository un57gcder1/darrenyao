# About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Darren Yao, a student at Carlmont High School (Class of 2021) interested in mathematics and computer science.

# Competitive Programming
USACO BEGINNERS: READ THIS BRIEF ARTICLE FIRST: [How to be Better at USACO](http://darrenyao.com/beginner)

The USA Computing Olympiad is the national computer science olympiad for American high school students. The USACO holds four contests each year, in December, January, February, and March (US Open). The contest takes place in four divisions, where students scoring sufficiently high are promoted to the next division. 

I currently compete in the Platinum division of the [USA Computing Olympiad](http://usaco.org) (top 200 students nationally). 

In addition, I'm the author of the book _An Introduction to the USA Computing Olympiad_, written as a one-stop-shop comprehensive training resource for the Bronze and Silver divisions of the USACO. This book was written to fulfill the need of a standard textbook aimed for the USACO, analogous to AoPS Volume 1 for math or HRK for physics. Furthermore, I believe that expensive training classes should not be necessary, and that self-study, at least at the lower levels, should be possible and easy. Links to the book are below:

- [C++ Edition](http://darrenyao.com/usacobook/cpp.pdf)

### Errata

- Chapter 10, Adjacency List, bad grammar
- Java Edition, page 20. After `map.remove(11);` the comment should say `// [(3, 5); (10, 491)]`

# Math

Here's a few expository papers I've written on various topics:

- [Solving a Diophantine Equation with Elliptic Curves](http://darrenyao.com/expository-papers/diophantineec.pdf)
- [On Methods of Evaluating Divergent Series](http://darrenyao.com/expository-papers/div_series.pdf)
- [Introduction to Division Algebras over Fields](http://darrenyao.com/expository-papers/intro_alg_field.pdf)
